### 🔧 Technologies Integrated

**Installed & Configured:**
- React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- Supabase (auth, database, storage)
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS
- Fabric.js (for template builder - ready to use)

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Configure Environment
```bash
# Edit .env file and add your Supabase anonymous key:
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations
```sql
-- Execute the advertisement table migration
-- File: supabase/migrations/20251010120000_add_advertisements_table.sql
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎯 What's Next (Remaining 60%)

### High Priority:
1. **Excel Upload** - Bulk student import with column mapping
2. **ZIP Photo Upload** - Bulk photo upload with filename matching
3. **Template Selection** - Choose from existing templates
4. **Template Builder** - Create/edit ID card designs (major feature)
5. **Admin Dashboard** - Enhanced statistics and management
6. **Order Management** - Admin order processing

## 🔐 Security Status

✅ Row Level Security (RLS) configured
✅ Authentication required for all school features
✅ Admin role verification
✅ File upload to secure storage
✅ Input validation
✅ HTTPS ready

## 🐛 Known Issues/Limitations

1. Photo editor uses basic background color (not AI removal)
2. Edit student is placeholder (needs implementation)
3. Template builder not started (major upcoming work)
4. Card generation system pending
5. Admin features minimal
6. No email/WhatsApp actual sending (infrastructure ready)

## 💡 Tips for Continued Development

1. **Template Builder** will be the most complex feature - budget 20-30 hours
2. **Card Generation** requires careful testing for print quality
3. **Excel Upload** needs robust error handling for various file formats
4. Consider adding real-time subscriptions for order updates
5. Implement proper image optimization before upload
6. Add comprehensive error logging

## 📝 Next Steps for User

1. ✅ Review the built features (start dev server)
2. ✅ Add Supabase key to .env
3. ✅ Run database migrations
4. ✅ Test school registration and login
5. ✅ Test adding students with photos
6. ✅ Review the code structure
7. 🔲 Continue with Excel upload implementation
8. 🔲 Build template selection page
9. 🔲 Start template builder
10. 🔲 Implement card generation

## 🙏 Summary

**Built:** A fully functional school management system where schools can register, add students with photos, manage their data, and submit orders. The foundation is solid with proper architecture, routing, authentication, and database integration.

**Remaining:** Advanced features like bulk uploads, template management, admin tools, and the card generation/printing system.

**Build Status:** ✅ Compiles successfully  
**Ready for:** Testing and continued development  
**Estimated Completion:** ~60% remaining (~40-50 hours of development)
